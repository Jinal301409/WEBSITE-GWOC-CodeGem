      "I had a great experience at the Ice Bath Centre! The place is clean, hygienic, and very well maintained. I tried the ice bath, Epsom salt bath, and steam bath — each one was super relaxing and helped a lot with muscle recovery.Saurav, who takes session is polite, informative, and makes you feel comfortable throughout the session. Overall, a perfect place for recovery and self-care. Highly recommended!"
